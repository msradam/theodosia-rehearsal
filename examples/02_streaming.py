"""Streaming Burr action surfaced as MCP progress notifications.

Burr supports streaming actions via ``@streaming_action``: the
function yields intermediate chunks plus a final state. theodosia
detects these and forwards each chunk to the client via
``ctx.report_progress``, the MCP-spec mechanism for partial results
during a long-running tool call. The final state arrives as the
regular tool response when the action completes.

This example narrates a short story chunk by chunk. In a real
system the chunks could be LLM tokens, retrieved documents,
streaming subprocess output, or anything else worth surfacing
incrementally.

Run as stdio:

    uv run python examples/streaming_narrate.py

Clients that don't supply a ``progressToken`` on their tool call
won't see the intermediate chunks; the action still runs and the
final result still arrives. Claude Code supports progress
notifications and will surface the chunks.
