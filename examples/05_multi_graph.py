"""Two graphs in one MCP server via ``mount_multi``.

Most multi-graph setups run one ``theodosia serve`` per graph: separate
processes, each with its own ``theodosia://graph``, disambiguated by the client.
``mount_multi`` is the other option: compose several Burr Applications into a
single server. FastMCP namespacing then applies:

* Tools are renamed ``<app>_<tool>``: ``orders_step`` and ``tickets_step``.
* Resources carry the namespace in the URI: ``theodosia://orders/graph``,
  ``theodosia://tickets/next``, and so on.
* A parent ``theodosia://apps`` resource lists the mounted names so an agent can
  discover the surface in one read.

Run it:

    python examples/multi_graph.py

Then drive ``orders_step`` and ``tickets_step`` independently from one client.
