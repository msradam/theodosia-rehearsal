"""burr-shell: natural-language shell against a sandboxed FS.

The user asks for shell operations in plain English ("list the files",
"count lines in data.csv", "make a notes/today.md with the headline").
The agent translates intent to a shell command and calls
``execute(command=...)``; the server runs it against a **per-session
temp sandbox** (a fresh copy of ``examples/data/local_shell/``), captures
stdout / stderr / exit_code, and records the call in ``theodosia://history``.

Why this server exists when the agent already has a built-in shell:

* Every command is auditable in ``theodosia://history`` with full output.
* The sandbox is a temp dir; the shipped sample data is never mutated.
* Multiple MCP sessions get independent sandboxes; no cross-contamination.
* The agent CANNOT escape the sandbox (commands run with cwd set; we
  refuse absolute paths and ``..`` traversal in obvious cases).

USE THIS SERVER WHEN: the user says "use burr shell" or asks for shell
operations they want gated and recorded rather than fired through the
agent's built-in Bash. Do NOT route shell operations here automatically
when the user expects fast, ungated bash; this is a deliberately
auditable surface.

Run:

    uv run python examples/local_shell.py
