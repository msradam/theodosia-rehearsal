"""A tiny text adventure as an FSM, mirroring Burr's
``llm-adventure-game`` example.

Each room is a state. Each direction (or action like ``take_key`` or
``unlock_door``) is a transition gated on the agent being in the
right place and holding the right items. The agent connecting over
MCP can only call moves that are reachable from where it is now,
so a "go_north" call from the wrong room comes back as
``invalid_transition`` with the actually-legal moves listed in the
response.

The agent navigates a state space the server fully describes. The
full topology is one ``theodosia://graph`` read away; the agent doesn't
have to guess.

Map:

    +------------+        +------------+
    |   foyer    | --N--> |  library   |
    |            |        | (has key)  |
    +-----+------+        +------+-----+
          |                      |
          E                      W
          v                      |
    +------------+        +------+------+
    |   garden   | <--E-- |  hallway    |
    |            |        | (locked     |
    +------------+        |  door east) |
                          +-------------+

Goal: reach the garden via the hallway by unlocking the eastern door
with the key found in the library.

Compare with Burr's
``examples/llm-adventure-game`` for the same pattern driven by an
LLM-internal state machine; here the FSM is the wire-level API.
