"""upstream: a code-audit FSM that drives a filesystem MCP server THROUGH
theodosia (single surface).

Unlike ``external_tools_filesystem`` (advisory: the agent calls the
filesystem server itself), here theodosia is an MCP *client* to the
filesystem server. The agent connects to ONLY this theodosia server and
sees ONLY the ``step`` tool. The audit actions call the filesystem
server's tools from inside their bodies via ``call_upstream(...)``. The
filesystem tools are never exposed to the agent.

This is the honest "works with any MCP server" path: theodosia is in the
call path, every upstream read happens inside an action (so it advances
state), and it works with any compliant MCP server because fastmcp.Client
speaks every transport.

Audit target dir: ``$AUDIT_TARGET`` (defaults to the shipped vuln_demo).

Run:

    AUDIT_TARGET=/path/to/code \\
      theodosia serve upstream_filesystem:build_server --name code-audit

Then connect an agent to ONLY this server. It audits real files without
ever being given filesystem tools.
